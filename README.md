I am not a stranger to the dark <br/>
Hide away, they say <br/>
'Cause we don't want your broken parts <br/>
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars <br/>
Run away, they say <br/>
No one'll love you as you are <br/>
But I won't let them break me down to dust <br/>
I know that there's a place for us <br/>
For we are glorious <br/>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br/>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out <br/>
I am brave, I am bruised <br/>
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me <br/>
Look out 'cause here I come <br/>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum <br/>
I'm not scared to be seen <br/>
I make no apologies, this is me <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh <br/>
Another round of bullets hits my skin <br/>
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in <br/>
We are bursting through the barricades and <br/>
Reaching for the sun (we are warriors)<br/>
Yeah, that's what we've become (yeah, that's what we've become) <br/>
I won't let them break me down to dust <br/>
I know that there's a place for us <br/>
For we are glorious <br/>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br/>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out <br/>
I am brave, I am bruised <br/>
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me <br/>
Look out 'cause here I come <br/>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum <br/>
I'm not scared to be seen <br/>
I make no apologies, this is me <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh-oh <br/>
# Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh <br/>
This is me <br/>
and I know that I deserve your love <br/>
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) 'cause there's nothing I'm not worthy of <br/>
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh) <br/>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br/>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out <br/>
This is brave, this is proof <br/>
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me <br/>
Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come) <br/>
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on) <br/>
I'm not scared to be seen <br/>
I make no apologies, this is me <br/>
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down <br/>
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out <br/>
I'm gonna send a flood <br/>
Gonna drown them out <br/>
# Oh
This is me <br/>
